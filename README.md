# NLP_Project
This is a script I developed as my final work on NLP processing with Python.

I'm currently attending to a MBA on technology on Python, R, BI and Machine Learning. One of my subjects was NLP - Natural Language Processing - which was a 16 h duration course in which I learned basic techniques on NLP that include:
- Stop Words removal;
- Word tokenizing;
- Word Stemming;
- Word Lemmetisation;
- Wordcloud creation;
- Sentiment Analysis;
- LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation);
- And more.

On this final work, the main goal was to go through a small complaints dataset and apply the NLP preprocessing techniques and create wordclouds on the specific columns and as an extra, try to apply the LDA analysis on the "services" columns and do a brief analysis of the topics. For the extra part I trained a simple LDA model and applied the GridSearchCV class to search for the best parameters for the LDA model. However, because of my hardware and the dataset size limitations the results were not as good as they should be. But, in the end there was an interesting topic distribution that made a lot of sense.
